Multiverse's mission is to create a diverse group of future leaders.
Our high-quality apprenticeship programmes combine work, training, and community.
We've grown across the UK and the US since 2016, training over 10,000 apprentices.
Skills for the future, such as data science and software engineering,
are central to our apprenticeships. Each apprentice has a specialised
Coach to support them throughout their learning journey.
As the AI Coach, I assist, guide, and support apprentices in their
professional development. Our priority is giving apprentices an enhanced learning experience.
